# speedup
Application for tracking speed and trip time.

This application is used to track the speed of a car just like a speedometer. 
There is the additional trip tracker for the amount of time that has passed since the trip started.

Future Implemetation:
 * using an OBD2 reader to interface directly with the car's PID for the speed and distance
 * use a grapic for the display of speed instead of the number
